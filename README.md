Needs a better name but hey.

# Releases
If you want to get the most reliable version, check the releases, any other links can be in development and non working (currently no design is verified working yet).

## Overview
This project aims to create an easy-to-use, multi-system TAS replay device to be used on actual consoles. The name of this project comes from the fact that it is powered by a STM32H745ZIT6 microcontroller.
